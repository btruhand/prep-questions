from math import ceil

# We have a list of integers, where:
# The integers are in the range 1..n
# The list has a length of n+1
# It follows that our list has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.
#
# Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our list. (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)
#
# We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Displayâ„¢. Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM. So we need to optimize for space!

# Complexity requirement: O(nlogn)
# Space requirement: O(1)

## algorithm explanation:
## find elements within the quadrants [low, center), [center, high]
## due to constraint of the question (duplicates ensured), one of the quadrants
## has to have higher amount of elements than the possible range of the quadrant
## quadrants are defined by the integer range not list size
